			<h3>My Story</h3>
			<p>I'm a street musician with an undergrad background in pre-med sciences, music, and urban design. I've always loved designing experiences-- whether it was organizing presentations, generating promotional material for student organizations, or writing music for films. My goal is to produce products that have larger and more global impacts, and I know that I need to learn how to perform in an orchestra of talent to do that rather than playing solo.</p>

			<h3>My Future</h3>
			<p>I'm fresh out of college with a degree that can best be described "Basic Science and Design with Music Sprinkles," so it's a little tricky for me to find a regular job. Above all, I want to be self-sustaining. My parents have been providing and continue to provide me with everything I've ever needed to explore my talents and hobbies, so I want to be able to start generating my own worth via an organized system. I'm not sure exactly what I'll be doing, but I don't want to limit it to one thing. What I've learned from my college experience, though, is that I have two passions: performing and organization of ideas into well-designed presentations. Whatever I do, as long as it provides either one of those qualities, attracts motivated people, and is providing an obvious service to a population, I'll be happy.</p>

			<h3>My Musical Influences</h3>
			<p>What is your musical style? My main musical influences are Gabe Bondoc, Jamie Foxx, John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, and Eminem. I like to sing soul/ballad and R&B/Hip-Hop. My favorite thing to do is to take some of these R&B/Hip-Hop songs (mostly aimed at a younger population) and twist them into genres that some of the older population might enjoy. I think some of these songs have meaningful lyrics, but sometimes the vehicle of instrumental accompaniment they ride in turns off the wrong people.</p>
